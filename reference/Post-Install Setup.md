# Post-Install Config

## Logins

Log into the following apps:

- 1Password
- Dropbox (Suggest selective sync until the Apps directories are synced)

## Local Aliases

There are aliases that I create for work that I don't want in a public repository. During setup, a `.local_aliases.sh` file is created in your home directory that you can add aliases to that will not be added to the repository.

## Install Extras

There are several scripts in the `post_install_scripts` folder for finishing setup of macOS.

- [macOS config](post_install_scripts/20_osx_config.sh)
- [macOS keyfixer](post_install_scripts/20_osx_keyfixer.sh)
- [macOS Sublime Text 3 setup](post_install_scripts/40_osx_sublime_text.sh)
- [macOS iTem2 and Terminal config](post_install_scripts/50_osx_item_and_terminal.sh)
